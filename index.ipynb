    "Recommendation systems are powerful tools that use machine learning algorithms to provide suggestions that are useful to users based on behaviour or habit patterns or user data. \n",
    "A Book Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences and behavior. Recommendation systems enhance user engagement, drive sales, and improve customer satisfaction by providing personalized suggestions. This project aims to utlize advance machine learning tools to develop a book recommendation system that is tailored to meet personalized customers needs and preferences therefore helping customers with the challenge of locating or choosing which books to read considering the large electronic book presence.  \n",

    "There are two primary approaches to recommendation systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collaborative Filtering – Uses user behavior and preferences to make recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Content-Based Filtering – Suggests books based on the features and attributes of previously liked books"
