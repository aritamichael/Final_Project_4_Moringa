    "A Book Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences and behavior. Recommendation systems enhance user engagement, drive sales, and improve customer satisfaction by providing personalized suggestions. This project aims to utlize advance machine learning tools to develop a book recommendation system that is tailored to meet personalized customers needs and preferences therefore helping customers with the challenge of locating or choosing which books to read considering the large electronic book presence. The data used is from Kaggle  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somnambwl/bookcrossing-dataset/data)\n",
